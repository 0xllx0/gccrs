	not be finalized at all in the warning given when the type is an

2024-01-23  Ronan Desplanques  <desplanques@adacore.com>

2024-01-09  Gary Dismukes  <dismukes@adacore.com>

	* exp_aggr.adb (Expand_Container_Aggregate): Add code to determine
	whether the aggregate is an indexed aggregate, setting a flag
	(Is_Indexed_Aggregate), which is tested to have proper separation
	of treatment for the Add_Unnamed
	(for positional aggregates) and New_Indexed (for indexed
	aggregates) cases. In the code generating associations for indexed
	aggregates, remove the code for Expressions cases entirely, since
	the code for indexed aggregates is governed by the presence of
	Component_Associations, and add an assertion that Expressions must
	be Empty. Also, exclude empty aggregates from entering that code.

	* atree.adb (Copy_Slots): Return without performing any updates if
	Destination equals Empty or Error, or if Source equals Empty. Any
	of those conditions indicates an error case.
	* sem_ch12.adb (Analyze_Formal_Derived_Type): Avoid cascading
